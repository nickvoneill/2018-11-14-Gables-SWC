  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This 2-day workshop will provide you with the basic 
  computing skills and best practices needed to be productive 
  in a small research team. The format is a mixture 
  of short seminars and hands-on practical exercises, 
  and participants are encouraged to help one another, 
  and to try applying what they have learned to their 
  own research problems during and between sessions.
